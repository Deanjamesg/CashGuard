## Design Considerations
* We wanted the application to be as modern and as sleek as possible. This is to ensure that the application looks attractive and professional as possible.
* The UI Design is to be as easy as possible to follow so that the user does not get confused when making use of the application.

## Features
* Create own user categories.
* Create transacitons (incomes or expense).
* Create their own budget.
* Filter transactions to see all transactions in that specific category for a user selcted time period.
* Filter either income or expense totals in a user given time period.
* Progress bars to display how how all expenses are split.
* Allows user to customise their own budgets.
* Pie chart to show the user their incomes vs expenses to show them their current savings.

## Innovative Features
* Gamification of the app so that the user can be more engaged and commited when they budget. This increased attention to the budgeting app will help users follow their budget goals and save money.
* Detailed breakdown of expenses so that the user can have a comprehsnive budget history. This helps the user track their expenses in more deatil and can help with taxes and expenses tracking. 
* The insights offered by the app help reveal trends for the user. This helps with pattern recognition and see bad habitual spending so that the user can eliminate unnessicary spending month to month.

## Concepts used
* LiveData and Room Database are being used, LiveData is to store & Update new transactions.
* Bottom navigation bar allows the userto navigate home to dashboard and gives user a more enhanced UI/Ux interface.
